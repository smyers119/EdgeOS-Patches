        * [r208] ddclient: cosmetic, remove stray space indent
        * [r207] ddclient: Support IPv6 for CloudFlare
        * [r206] ddclient: name cheap support https now

          From name cheap it seems http is supported now.
          Since the password was send on plaintext, https should be used

        * [r205] ddclient: Use JSON::PP instead of the (deprecated)
          JSON::Any
        * [r204] ddclient: Follow expected behavior

          Align ddclient behavior and documentation with namecheap's -
          https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/583/11/how-do-i-configure-ddclient

        * [r203] ddclient: Specify port number properly to 'nsupdate' (#58)

          If a port number is included in the 'server' configuration item,
          ddclient allows a port number to be specified by appending a
          colon
          and the port number to the server's name or IPv4 address.
          However,
          nsupdate does not support this syntax, it requires the port
          number
          to be separated from the server name/address by whitespace.

          Adding configurable TTL to Cloudflare

          This change adds configurable TTL to cloudflare instead of just
          using hardcoded value of 1 which sets "automatic" TTL any time
          ddclient updates the IP address.

	* [r181] ddclient: ddclient: made json optional

	* [r164] ddclient: Only delete A RR, not any RR for the FQDN

	  Make the delete command specific to A RRs. This prevents ddclient
	  from deleting other RRs unrelated to the dynamic address, but on the
	  same FQDN. This can be specifically a problem with KEY RRs when using
	  SIG(0) instead of symmetric keys.
